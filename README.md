# ðŸŒ˜good nightðŸŒ’

## what does it do?

this is a little app for macos that turns display to grayscale for a specified time every day.
this is independent from accessibility option and can be turned on and off manually inside the app.

i made it to help with insomnia after seeing bedtime mode for android.

have fun, sleep wellðŸŒš

## future plans, maybe

* at some point i might figure out a way for it to also toggle "night shift" and "do not disturb" options.

## how to use
1. install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. install [cargo-bundle](https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle)
3. run `cargo bundle --release`
4. you will find the application at the path that `cargo bundle --release` prints out.
