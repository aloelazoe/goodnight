# ðŸŒ˜good nightðŸŒ’

## what does it do?

this is a little app for macos that turns display to grayscale for a specified time every day.
this is independent from accessibility option and can be turned on and off manually inside the app.

i made it to help with insomnia after seeing bedtime mode for android.

have fun, sleep wellðŸŒš

## future plans, maybe

* at some point i might figure out a way for it to also toggle "night shift" and "do not disturb" options.
